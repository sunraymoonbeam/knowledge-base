# Text Editing with Nano

**Nano** is a simple, user-friendly text editor for Unix-like systems. It is often pre-installed on many Linux distributions and provides an easy way to create and edit text files directly from the terminal.

In many cases, a graphical user interface (GUI) is not available for editing filesâ€”for example, when running Docker containers. This makes learning terminal-based text editors, like Nano, valuable. Other alternatives include **vim** or **emacs**.
